          This is a project for the design and development of a commercial website. My team and I first established the
          website's style and brand positioning in this project. It is a luxury jewelry website with a minimalist design
          approach. Once the main tone of the website was determined, we proceeded to design the interactive elements of
          the web pages to ensure a consistent and appealing appearance across various devices. The specific development
          of the website involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout and animation effects. As for generating
          images for the website, Photoshop and Figma were used as the primary tools.<br>

      Three Iterations
    </h3>

    <p class="audience_text">
      In this section, we have presented our comprehensive research proposal on the topic "The Relationship Between
      Negative Mentality and Irrational Consumption Behavior." Our aim is to explore the impact of negative mentalities
      triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on irrational consumption behavior among young college students in Canada.
      For the quantitative phase, we plan to conduct a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among Canadian university
      students to measure our negative mentality and irrational consumption behavior. We will also consider control
      variables such as our gender, age, part-time income, perceived personality, and history of mental illness.
      In the qualitative phase, we will use open-ended questions to gather our thoughts on the leading causes of
      irrational consumption among university students during the pandemic. We will then use thematic analysis to
      identify key themes and factors influencing our irrational consumption.
      We believe that our proposed research has strengths, including adopting research methods that have proven
      successful in previous literature and addressing previously neglected aspects of irrational consumer behavior
      among college students. However, there are limitations, such as the sample being limited to university students
      and the potential for recall bias in our qualitative data.
      Our intended audience for this study is primarily academic peers in the field of communication studies and others
      interested in the topic. We will follow ethical considerations and adhere to SFU Guidelines for Research
      Ethics.
      Overall, we have presented a well-structured research proposal with clear objectives and a thoughtful research
      design to explore the relationship between negative mentality and irrational consumption behavior among young
      college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Three Iterations
    </h3>

    <p class="co_designer_info">The website underwent three significant iterations, from its initial concept to the
      final product. We boldly poured our ideas into creating the website's style guide and a few basic pages during the
      first iteration. The layout of these pages was not mature, lacked balance, contained excessive white space, and
      lacked animation and interactivity.

      Some of these issues were discovered and addressed during the second iteration, while others were modified and
      perfected in the final major iteration. During the second iteration, we added a popup feedback feature after users
      submitted forms and took inspiration from numerous luxury and jewelry brand websites to maintain a clean and tidy
      homepage. We decided to use a classical painting as the main image for the homepage and designed a simple layout.
      However, we later realized that a single image on the homepage looked too sparse.

      Therefore, we incorporated a video on the website's homepage in the third iteration. After extensive searching on
      free video websites, we found a video that best matched the brand name and vibe. To ensure adaptive design with
      the video background, we converted the video into a webp format image animation. We were pleased with the result.
      In the final iteration, we fixed the form to make it more user-friendly and added a carousel effect to the product
      showcase page.</p>
