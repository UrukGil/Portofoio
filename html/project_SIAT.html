      <h3>About the Brand</h3>
      <p>
        Our brand is named Aethel, the positioning of this brand is a luxury jewelry company with a minimalist design
        approach. One of the core characteristics of the brand is the passion for and pursuit of abstract art,
        integrating the subtle beauty of the natural world into our designs to create jewelry pieces that are dynamic
        and profound. Furthermore, to accentuate the brand's distinct aesthetic, we have chosen to showcase our unique
        perspective through the selection of collaborating designers. Each design product of the brand encapsulates
        profound significance, representing the pursuit of inner peace, harmony, and beauty, inspiring individuals to
        seek moments of tranquillity amidst the modern hustle and bustle of life. Once the main tone of the website
        was determined, we proceeded to design the interactive elements of the web pages to ensure a consistent and
        appealing appearance across various devices.

      <h3>About the Design</h3>

      <p>Our brand's website style has been meticulously crafted to align perfectly with the
        brand's vibe and characteristics. The webpage exhibits a modern, minimalist, and exquisite design. The neutral
        gray background enhances content clarity while conveying the brand's gravitas and contemporary feel. The
        scrolling glass spheres further accentuate the brand's clarity and dynamism.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of colour selection, we have employed soft, cool gray-blue and delicate gray tones. These hues not only
        enhance the web page's clarity but also resonate with the brand's nobility and tranquillity. Additionally, the
        visual elements on the webpage, such as images, icons, and typography, harmonize with the brand's modern
        artistic style.
      </p>

      <p>
        The design elements of geometric shapes and streamlined logos amplify the webpage's modernity while unifying
        with
        the brand's pursuit of elegance and sophistication. Font choices have also been meticulously curated, utilizing
        modern and legible typography that further underscores the brand's contemporary and stylish attributes.
      </p>

      <p>
        All in all, our brand's webpage style expertly combines colours, design elements, and layout to effectively
        encapsulate the core characteristics and values of the brand. The webpage not only provides visitors with a
        delightful visual experience but also aligns with the brand's ethos, showcasing a modern, luxurious, and
        high-quality brand image.

    <h3>About the Development</h3>
    <p>
      The specific development of the website involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
      layout and animation effects. As for generating images for the website, Photoshop and Figma were used as the
      primary tools.

      <h3>Three Iterations & Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        The website underwent three significant iterations, from its initial concept to the
        final product. We boldly poured our ideas into creating the website's style guide and a few basic pages during
        the
        first iteration. During the second iteration, we added a popup feedback feature after users submitted forms and
        took inspiration from numerous luxury and jewelry brand websites to maintain a clean and tidy homepage. We
        decided
        to use a classical painting as the main image for the homepage and designed a simple layout. However, we later
        realized that a single image on the homepage looked too sparse and couldnâ€™t tell much about the brand.
        Therefore,
        we incorporated a video on the website's homepage in the third iteration. After extensive searching on free
        video
        websites, we found a video that best matched the brand name and vibe. To ensure adaptive design with the video
        background, we converted the video into a webp format image animation. We were pleased with the result. In the
        final iteration, we fixed the form to make it more user-friendly and added a carousel effect to the product
        showcase page. However, in the end. The layout of these pages was still not mature.
