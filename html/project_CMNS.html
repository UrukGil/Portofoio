        <p>
          This research aims to explore the causes of mindless consumption behaviour during the COVID-19 pandemic and
          the role of the media in influencing negative mental states and irrational consumption behaviour triggered by
          sudden public health events. It is a collaborative effort between a four-person team and is scheduled for
          completion by the Spring of 2022.

    <h3>Quantitative Research Design</h3>
    <p>
      The quantitative research design involves two distinct studies conducted by separate research teams. The first
      study by Hu, Yue-Qian, Xie Piao, Wang Ying, Huang Zhi-Xin, Wu Yi-Ting, and Sun Hai-Long from the School of
      Business at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in China aimed to investigate the relationship between
      Negative Mentality and Irrational Consumption Behavior. This study employed an online scale-questions
      questionnaire administered to 466 Chinese participants. The independent variable in this study was Negative
      Mentality, while the dependent variable was Irrational Consumption Behavior.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second study, conducted by Bentall RP, Lloyd A, Bennett K, McKay R, Mason L, et al., focused on Pandemic
      Buying and tested a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying during the early phase of the
      COVID-19 pandemic. This study involved participants from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, with an
      online scale-questions questionnaire distributed to 2025 participants from each country. The study's independent
      variable included Depression and Generalized Anxiety Level, and the dependent variable was Over-purchasing.
      Control variables such as age, gender, and income were also considered in the analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Both studies utilized questionnaire questions that were based on existing literature to ensure accuracy and
      precision. The collected data underwent reanalysis using SPSS to calculate correlation coefficients, p-values,
      and scatter diagrams, providing valuable insights into the relationships between the variables under
      investigation.

    <h3>Qualitative Research Design</h3>
    <p>
      The qualitative research design for this study involves a discourse analysis of the top 20 Quora answers. This
      approach was chosen due to the belief that individuals are more inclined to express their authentic emotions and
      opinions on the Quora platform. By analyzing the content of these top-rated responses, the research aims to gain
      deeper insights into people's genuine thoughts and perceptions regarding the topic under investigation. This
      qualitative approach provides an opportunity to explore the nuances of participants' attitudes and experiences in
      relation to the research focus, ultimately contributing to a richer understanding of the phenomenon.

      <h3>Research Conclusion</h3>

      <p>
        The analysis of data from both China and England & Ireland supports the hypothesis that negative mentality
        significantly and positively correlates with irrational consumption during the pandemic (P-value less then 0.01,
        indicating a significant correlation; |r|> 0). Notably, this influence of negative emotions on irrational
        consumption is notably more pronounced in China (r = 0.568) compared to Ireland (r = 0.28) and England (r =
        0.253).
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, the study reveals that control variables including age, gender, and income do not exert a
        discernible impact on irrational consumption behaviors during the COVID-19 period. Among the findings, social
        psychological factors emerge as the most frequently cited contributors to irrational consumption, while coping
        behavior is not identified as a primary driver of excessive purchasing. The study suggests that misinformation
        and rumors propagated by news media play a significant role in amplifying public panic and anxiety, thereby
        influencing shifts in consumer behavior.
