          At the very beginning, as a group, we decided on our research topic as "How people's emotional changes during
          the epidemic affect and change their consumption habits." Afterward, each member of our group conducted data
          collection and organization and completed their respective literature reviews.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Research Topic and Objectives:</h4>
        <p>Research Topic and Objectives: We clearly defined our research topic as exploring how people's emotional
          changes during the pandemic influence their consumption habits. Our aim was to conduct the literature search
          from three main perspectives: changes in people's consumption during the pandemic, the changing mood of
          people during the pandemic, and broader literature on emotionally influenced consumption.</p><br><br>
        <h4>Empirical Research Studies:</h4>
        <p>We found three empirical research studies, one focusing on panic buying behavior during the pandemic, and
          the other two examining changes in dietary and consumption habits during the pandemic. These studies
          employed empirical methods to investigate the influence of emotional changes on consumption behaviors. While
          some results supported our hypotheses, others contradicted them.</p><br><br>
        <h4>Non-Empirical Studies:</h4>
        <p>We also discovered several non-empirical studies that explored the impact of psychological factors on food
          purchasing decisions during the pandemic. These studies provided theoretical foundations for our
          research.<br><br>
        </p>
        <h4>Other Sources of Information:</h4>
        <p>Apart from empirical and non-empirical studies, we gathered information from data tables, bar charts, and
          news sources. These sources offer valuable insights and support for our research hypotheses.</p><br><br>
        <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
        <p>After analyzing the literature, we concluded that emotional changes during the pandemic indeed influenced
          people's consumption habits. However, there were discrepancies in some research findings, and we identified
          certain limitations and further research opportunities. We proposed the need for in-depth investigations
          into the long-term effects of emotional changes on consumption habits and the influence of regional factors
          on consumer behaviors during and after the pandemic.</p>

      Paper Propsal
    </h3>

    <p class="audience_text">
      In this section, we have presented our comprehensive research proposal on the topic "The Relationship Between
      Negative Mentality and Irrational Consumption Behavior." Our aim is to explore the impact of negative mentalities
      triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic on irrational consumption behavior among young college students in Canada.
      For the quantitative phase, we plan to conduct a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among Canadian university
      students to measure our negative mentality and irrational consumption behavior. We will also consider control
      variables such as our gender, age, part-time income, perceived personality, and history of mental illness.
      In the qualitative phase, we will use open-ended questions to gather our thoughts on the leading causes of
      irrational consumption among university students during the pandemic. We will then use thematic analysis to
      identify key themes and factors influencing our irrational consumption.
      We believe that our proposed research has strengths, including adopting research methods that have proven
      successful in previous literature and addressing previously neglected aspects of irrational consumer behavior
      among college students. However, there are limitations, such as the sample being limited to university students
      and the potential for recall bias in our qualitative data.
      Our intended audience for this study is primarily academic peers in the field of communication studies and others
      interested in the topic. We will follow ethical considerations and adhere to SFU Guidelines for Research
      Ethics.
      Overall, we have presented a well-structured research proposal with clear objectives and a thoughtful research
      design to explore the relationship between negative mentality and irrational consumption behavior among young
      college students during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Final Report
    </h3>

    <p class="co_designer_info">In this research, we aimed to explore the main reasons for mindless consumption behavior
      during the COVID-19 pandemic and its relationship with negative mentalities triggered by the public health
      emergency. We conducted mixed qualitative and quantitative research to gain a comprehensive understanding of this
      phenomenon.

      The qualitative component involved a discourse analysis of answers to the question "Why did people start to panic
      buy during the COVID-19 pandemic?" on Quora. We categorized the responses into fear of the unknown and social
      psychosocial factors, with fear of the unknown (negative mentality) being mentioned most frequently as the primary
      reason for irrational purchasing. The spread of social misinformation and rumors through news media played a role
      in influencing the public's consumption behavior, creating a snowball effect.

      To test the hypothesis that negative mentality increases irrational consumer behavior, we collected quantitative
      data from Bentall et al.'s study in the UK & Ireland and Hu et al.'s study in China. We used online surveys with
      questionnaires focused on changes in personal consumption profiles as the dependent variable and negative
      mentality scales as the independent variable. The results showed that negative mentality significantly positively
      predicted irrational consumption during the pandemic in both China and the UK & Ireland, with China showing
      stronger intensity of negative emotions towards mindless consumption.

      Overall, our findings suggest that negative attitudes generated by a public health emergency are the main drivers
      of irrational consumption behaviors, such as impulse shopping and overshopping. These attitudes may also be
      influenced by national epidemic prevention policies or mediated by negative news. This research provides valuable
      insights into understanding consumer behavior during crises and emphasizes the importance of addressing negative
      mentalities in managing consumption patterns.</p>
