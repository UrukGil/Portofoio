    <h2 class="this_title">The Relationship Between Negative Mentality and Irrational Consumption Behavior</h2>

    <div class="sum">

      <div class="sum_text">
        <p>
          At the very beginning, as a group, we decided on our research topic as "How people's emotional changes during
          the epidemic affect and change their consumption habits." Afterward, each member of our group conducted data
          collection and organization and completed their respective literature reviews.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Research Topic and Objectives:</h4>
          <p>Research Topic and Objectives: We clearly defined our research topic as exploring how people's emotional
            changes during the pandemic influence their consumption habits. Our aim was to conduct the literature search
            from three main perspectives: changes in people's consumption during the pandemic, the changing mood of
            people during the pandemic, and broader literature on emotionally influenced consumption.</p><br><br>
          <h4>Empirical Research Studies:</h4>
          <p>We found three empirical research studies, one focusing on panic buying behavior during the pandemic, and
            the other two examining changes in dietary and consumption habits during the pandemic. These studies
            employed empirical methods to investigate the influence of emotional changes on consumption behaviors. While
            some results supported our hypotheses, others contradicted them.</p><br><br>
          <h4>Non-Empirical Studies:</h4>
          <p>We also discovered several non-empirical studies that explored the impact of psychological factors on food
            purchasing decisions during the pandemic. These studies provided theoretical foundations for our research.<br><br>
          </p>
          <h4>Other Sources of Information:</h4>
          <p>Apart from empirical and non-empirical studies, we gathered information from data tables, bar charts, and
            news sources. These sources offer valuable insights and support for our research hypotheses.</p><br><br>
          <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
          <p>After analyzing the literature, we concluded that emotional changes during the pandemic indeed influenced
            people's consumption habits. However, there were discrepancies in some research findings, and we identified
            certain limitations and further research opportunities. We proposed the need for in-depth investigations
            into the long-term effects of emotional changes on consumption habits and the influence of regional factors
            on consumer behaviors during and after the pandemic.</p>
