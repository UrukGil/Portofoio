        <p>Hey! My name is Abigail. Currently, I am pursuing my studies in the SIAT program at Simon Fraser
          University (SFU) in Canada, with a concentration in the field of design. I have a passion for art and design,
          and
          I am skilled in using various design tools. I love exploring and experimenting with different cool design
          styles.
        </p>

        <p>My interests are incredibly diverse, and I am also devoted to media studies. This is the reason why I have
          not
          only pursued studies in the SIAT program but also have a profound understanding of communication studies.
          Additionally, I have a passion for learning Japanese and enjoy practicing drawing.</p>

        <p>In the future, I aspire to further delve into the design field and take part in more challenging projects to
          create intriguing and aesthetically pleasing design solutions for society. You can reach out to me through my
          email at <a class="in_text_link" href="#">Abigail@email.com</a> and I look forward to the opportunity of
          further

          This is a project for the design and development of a commercial website. My team and I first established the
          website's style and brand positioning in this project. It is a luxury jewelry website with a minimalist design
          approach. Once the main tone of the website was determined, we proceeded to design the interactive elements of
          the
          web pages to ensure a consistent and appealing appearance across various devices. The specific development of
          the
          website involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for layout and animation effects. As for generating images
          for
          the website, Photoshop and Figma were used as the primary tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website underwent three significant iterations, from its initial concept to the final product. We boldly
          poured our ideas into creating the website's style guide and a few basic pages during the first iteration. The
          layout of these pages was not mature, lacked balance, contained excessive white space, and lacked animation
          and
          interactivity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these issues were discovered and addressed during the second iteration, while others were modified and
          perfected in the final major iteration. During the second iteration, we added a popup feedback feature after
          users
          submitted forms and took inspiration from numerous luxury and jewelry brand websites to maintain a clean and
          tidy
          homepage. We decided to use a classical painting as the main image for the homepage and designed a simple
          layout.
          However, we later realized that a single image on the homepage looked too sparse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Therefore, we incorporated a video on the website's homepage in the third iteration. After extensive searching
          on
          free video websites, we found a video that best matched the brand name and vibe. To ensure adaptive design
          with
          the video background, we converted the video into a webp format image animation. We were pleased with the
          result.
          In the final iteration, we fixed the form to make it more user-friendly and added a carousel effect to the
          product
          showcase page.

          This is a project aimed at designing a health app specifically for the elderly population. The project
          utilizes
          various technologies, including Figma, Photoshop, and ProtoPie. In the initial stages, the team conducted
          research
          on the smartphone usage patterns of people aged 75 and above, focusing on health-related apps. The team
          identified
          the primary objectives and pain points of elderly users when using health apps. After summarizing the user
          journey, specific solutions were developed to address potential issues users might encounter and designed the
          features to meet old people's needs. The team then created detailed storyboards to visualize the scenarios.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the ideas were organized, team members meticulously considered colour schemes, fonts, and UI layouts.
          After
          final decisions were made, the software's wireframes were created in Figma.
        </p>
        <p>
          After obtaining the wireframes, we further categorized and organized the elements, moving them to ProtoPie for
          refinement. During this process, we paid close attention to what interactions and actions elderly users
          preferred
          and found most convenient with the least error probability. Once the software was refined on ProtoPie, we
          contacted our research participants again and requested their involvement in software testing. During the
          final
          iteration, we analyzed the test results and made improvements to the software's functionalities. The end
          product
          is showcased in the video.

          paragraph text, I opted for Geomanist, a clean and clear sans-serif font that ensures excellent readability

          a comfortable reading experience. This font combination effectively emphasizes the characteristics of my
          digital
          media and design works, ensuring an outstanding presentation of both visual and content aspects in my

      I chose black and yellow as the main color scheme to emphasize the novelty and avant-garde nature of digital
