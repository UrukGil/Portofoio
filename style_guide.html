    <p>Hey! My name is Abigail. Currently, I am pursuing my studies in the SIAT program at Simon Fraser
      University (SFU) in Canada, with a concentration in the field of design. I have a passion for art and design, and
      I am skilled in using various design tools. I love exploring and experimenting with different cool design styles.
    </p>

    <p>My interests are incredibly diverse, and I am also devoted to media studies. This is the reason why I have not
      only pursued studies in the SIAT program but also have a profound understanding of communication studies.
      Additionally, I have a passion for learning Japanese and enjoy practicing drawing.</p>

    <p>In the future, I aspire to further delve into the design field and take part in more challenging projects to
      create intriguing and aesthetically pleasing design solutions for society. You can reach out to me through my
      email at <a href="#">Abigail@email.com</a> and I look forward to the opportunity of further connecting with you.
    </p>
